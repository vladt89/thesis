The aim of the research was to analyse the communication model between SCSI controller and disks and find out the optimal way of sending WRITE and WRITE SAME commands. Several strategies of sending commands were applied, which gave the food for understanding where the bottlenecks are hidden. Moreover, these results supports the building of dynamic load balancing system, which finds the optimal values for commands.

The tests showed that during sending commands in series, the time increases linearly. After moving to the parallel strategy it was obvious that SCSI controller and disks can handle it that is why all the later experiments were done with the parallel strategy. The results gave a possibility to make a several conclusions. First of all, usage of WRITE SAME command allows to erase one 18.2 GB disk by sending only 304 kB of information and the time of the erasure depends directly from the disk speed. Secondly, the bottleneck of sending WRITE commands is the bus, because with that command we need to send the amount of data, which exceeds the sum of capacity of the disks. But that fact gave a possibility to vary the parameters and different tests helped to find out that the size of sending buffer is playing the main role. To make the process faster the buffer size should fit in the allocation memory of the SCSI controller that was found in the Linux driver. These facts played very important roles in building the dynamic load balancing system, which could be applied for sending the commands in optimal way.

For the future research we suggest to figure out if we discussed all the parameters of this communication. For example, there is the question why the erasure times of the disks with the same properties are so different during single erasure? Moreover, it would be a great step forward to balance the results of single erasure, which gives a possibility to make lower the value of complete erasure. In this research only one SCSI controller was considered and it is possible that another controller will have similar behaviour, but with its own specificities.
